# Social_Preferences
A Systematic characterization of preferences for generosity towards friends and stragners

Here we developed a novel trial seletion method which we applied to a 2AFC dictador game task in order to precisely characterize other-regarding preferences.

In this repository we include Data and Code relevant to our project. 

In the Codes folder, you can start by the Trial_selection folder and then move on to the Analysis folder, or go straight to the Analysis folder. Each one contained a README explanatory file.
