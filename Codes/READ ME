Trials Selection - Study 1:

This is the order in which you will need the successive pieces of code.

options.mat

Create_sim_data.m

Score_computationPerUT.m

Compile_Scores.m

Performance_analysis.m

    structure_initial_variables.m
    destructure_initial_variables.m
    fit_sim_subject.m
    test_models_ga.m
    loglike.m
   
Once the selected trials for the experiment are determined, and the data is colledted:

ANALYSIS_CODE.m
